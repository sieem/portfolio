During the day, we take light for granted. Itâ€™s in abundance and we tend not to notice the true beauty of light. During the night however, light plays its game in a different way. Paradoxically it reveals more of itself during this peaceful period. The scarcity makes it a special thing. Every bit of light transforms into an aura where shadow plays a big role. Umbra captures this special game of light and shadow with an approach that resembles the calm atmosphere of the night.
