Our privacy is at stake, but we tend to not care about this. Quite logical, it’s very hard to see what that lack of privacy actually implies. We can still hide our pictures and information from anyone else, right? On almost every way, the violation of our privacy happens in a non-visual digital way. Our personal information gets traded every millisecond across the whole web, without notifying us. Making it pretty easy to trade it with intelligence agencies, who can store that information for eternity. A horrifying thought, isn’t it? With the internet coming directly into our homes, our old way of thinking about privacy has no effect anymore. Perhaps we should start thinking how we can secure ourselves in different ways then just the physical way.
